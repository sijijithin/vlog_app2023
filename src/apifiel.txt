        Sunil Chhetri worked his magic but India had to split points with Kuwait after an acrimonious 1-1 draw in their last group match in the SAFF Championship on Tuesday. Chhetri had put India on the road to victory with an injury-time strike in the first half but an own goal by Anwar Ali in the added time of the second half spoiled the home side's march. This was also the first goal India conceded in nine matches. The result meant that India and Kuwait ended up on seven points but the latter topped Group A on better goal average. India will play Lebanon in the semifinal while Kuwait will take on either Bangladesh or Maldives. Already qualified for the semifinal, both India and Kuwait pressed forward
        from the whistle, giving some entertaining moments",

      "content":"Ek Kahani – A Dubai Story, a Malayalam short film with a simple story about trust and friendship, is winning hearts on YouTube. Directed by debutant Anoop Varghese, the 25-minute film about non-resident
      Indians in Dubai and their little big dreams, has struck a chord with viewers.Anoop, who has also written the story, says the film is partially based on a real-life incident. Speaking on phone from Dubai, where he works as a resource manager at Siemens, he says that it is a common practice among friends in the United Arab Emirates to pool in money to buy lottery tickets with big prizes. “In my film, one of the friends stays true to their bond although the other friend does not reciprocate. I wanted to celebrate the goodness of humanity through that true friend.
       I feel the celebration of goodness has made the short popular.",
